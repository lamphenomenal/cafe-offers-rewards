# ☕ Café Rewards Offer Analysis Dashboard

This project explores customer interactions with a loyalty and rewards program using SQL for data processing, Tableau for visual analytics, and PowerPoint for executive storytelling.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal was to analyze how different types of promotional offers (BOGO, discount, informational) influenced customer behavior in a simulated café rewards dataset. Key metrics like **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**, **completion rate**, and **offer-linked transactions** were calculated and visualized to uncover actionable insights.

## 🔍 Key Questions Answered
- Which channels (web, email, mobile, social) drive the highest completion rates?
- What types of offers are most effective (BOGO vs Discount)?
- How do customer demographics (age, gender, income) affect engagement?

---

## 📊 Tools & Skills Used
- **SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)** – CTEs, CASE WHEN, window functions, data type conversions
- **Tableau Public** – Dynamic dashboards with KPIs, bar charts, area charts, and calculated fields
- **Microsoft PowerPoint** – Executive-level storytelling and data-driven recommendations

---

## 📈 Sample Insights
- **BOGO offers** had the highest CTR.
- **DISCOUNT offers** had the highest Completion and transaction rates, implying that customers preferred prices to a "buy one get one free" offer.
- **WEMS (Web, Email, Mobile, Social)** channel grouping performed best in terms of conversion.
- **Young adults** and **mid-income groups** responded more actively to promotional offers.

---

## 🧠 Recommendations
- Scale high-performing offer types (BOGO3, DISCOUNT1) via WEMS channels.
- Re-evaluate informational campaigns due to low conversion.
- Tailor future offers based on demographic responsiveness and prior purchase behavior.
